.Sh NAME
.Nm PCI_PNP_INFO
.Nd register plug and play information for PCI device matching
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dev/pci/pcivar.h
.Fo PCI_PNP_INFO
.Fa "pci_device_table *table"
.Fc
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn PCI_PNP_INFO
macro registers a
.Fa table
of type pci_device_table which has device-identifying data for use by
.Xr devmatch 8 .
Since it is built off module marking macros, it must follow a
.Xr DRIVER_MODULE 9
line.
.Pp
The macro takes a
.Fa table
parameter that points to the device matching data with entries matching the structure
.Fa pci_device_table .

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
#include <sys/module.h>
#include <dev/pci/pcivar.h>
struct pci_device_table my_ids[] = {
	{ PCI_DEVID(0x12345678), PCI_DESCR("Foo bar") },
	{ PCI_DEVID(0x9abcdef0), PCI_DESCR("Baz fizz") },
};

PCI_PNP_INFO(my_ids);
